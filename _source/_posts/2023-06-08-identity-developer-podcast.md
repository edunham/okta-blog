Do you enjoy podcasts? I find that, like audiobooks, podcasts can transform boring tasks into an opportunity for entertainment and education. 

I'm delighted to announce a new offering from Okta's Workforce Developer Advocacy Team: our monthly podcast! 

The audio version of the Workforce Identity Developer Podcast is available on [Casted](https://listen.casted.us/public/49/Workforce-Identity-Developer-Podcast-4ce90a5f), where you can also explore Auth0's ongoing [Authorization in software podcast](https://authorizationinsoftware.auth0.com/public/49/Authorization-in-Software-f9b69587) and [Identity Unlocked](https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%2C-Unlocked.--bed7fada) podcast as well.

In March, with product manager Megha Rastogi, we discussed what Workforce Identity means, and review some of the history of security that gotu s here. We dig into phishing resistant MFA, and compare the relative benefits and drawbacks of WebAuthN and Passkeys.

In April, with Director of Technical Strategy Matt Egan, we explored the [Okta Integration Network](https://www.okta.com/integrations/) and compared OAuth integration between applications to its predecessor, SSWS tokens. Spoiler alert: Handing out a token that confers a lot of perms indefinitely to anyone who holds it isn't a great idea these days!

In May, with Product Acceleration Principal Architect Dan Marma, we discussed his recent Devday 2023 talk about [The Enterprise-Ready MVP](https://youtu.be/zL2U7qpdRZY), expanding our definition of "Okta Developers" to include everyone who builds code for customers who use Okta as their identity provider. Dan also shared some stories from the field, and I learned about some extreme use cases that enterprises have demanded from their identity providers and the apps that they use those identity providers to access!
